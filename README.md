## Description

Test functions given in the textbook by defining test functions to test the actual functions. Calculated number of digits in a given number by using the len function. Learned how to make a histogram using different numbers and orders of numbers.

## What I Learned from This

Learned how useful the len function can be, and how testing a function can benefit when doing much larger projects and pieces of work. Also learned how to further use python to visualize functions.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
* https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html <website that I use to help clarify special python functions and code"
